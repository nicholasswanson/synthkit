## ⚠️ Items Needing Attention

### Security Updates Required
- [ ] Update Next.js to 14.2.32+ (critical security fixes)
- [ ] Update other vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Run `pnpm audit fix` after updates

### Testing Coverage
- [ ] Add integration tests for API routes
- [ ] Add E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] Achieve >80% code coverage
- [ ] Add accessibility tests

### Monitoring Integration
- [ ] Connect error tracking service (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Configure log aggregation
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboards

### CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Automated testing on PR
- [ ] Security scanning in pipeline
- [ ] Automated dependency updates
- [ ] Deployment automation

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness Score: 85%

### What's Working Well
- Solid security foundation
- Good error handling
- Comprehensive documentation
- Performance optimizations in place

### What Needs Immediate Attention
1. **Security vulnerabilities** - Update dependencies NOW
2. **Test coverage** - Add more automated tests
3. **Monitoring** - Connect to real services

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Fix security vulnerabilities (1-2 hours)
2. Set up basic CI/CD (2-4 hours)
3. Add E2E tests (4-8 hours)
4. Connect monitoring services (2-4 hours)

## Quick Validation Commands

```bash
# Security check
pnpm audit

# Build test
pnpm build

# Type check
pnpm typecheck

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Performance test
node scripts/performance-test.js

# Check production build size
du -sh .next

# Verify environment setup
ls -la .env*
```

## Sign-off Criteria

Before deploying to production, ensure:
- [ ] All security vulnerabilities fixed
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Monitoring connected
- [ ] Deployment tested in staging
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Team trained on monitoring/alerts

---

**Current Status**: Ready for staging deployment after dependency updates. 
**Production Deployment**: Blocked until security updates complete.
