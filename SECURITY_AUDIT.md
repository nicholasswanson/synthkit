# Security Audit Report

Date: December 13, 2024

## Summary

Security audit revealed vulnerabilities primarily in outdated dependencies. The most critical issue is an outdated Next.js version with known security vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerabilities Found

### Critical (1)
- **Next.js Authorization Bypass** in middleware (>=14.0.0 <14.2.25)
  - Current version: 14.2.3
  - Required version: >=14.2.25

### High (2)
- **Next.js Cache Poisoning** (>=14.0.0 <14.2.10)
- **Next.js Authorization Bypass** (>=9.5.5 <14.2.15)

### Moderate (6)
- Various Next.js vulnerabilities related to DoS, SSRF, and content injection
- esbuild development server vulnerability

### Low (3)
- Next.js race condition and information exposure issues
- tmp package vulnerability in CLI tool

## Required Actions

### Immediate (Critical/High)
1. Update Next.js to latest version (>=14.2.32)
   ```yaml
   # In pnpm-workspace.yaml catalog:
   "next": "^14.2.32"
   ```

2. Run update and rebuild:
   ```bash
   pnpm update next
   pnpm build
   ```

### Short-term (Moderate)
1. Update esbuild via vitest update
2. Review and update all catalog dependencies

### Long-term (Low)
1. Implement automated dependency updates
2. Add security scanning to CI/CD pipeline

## Mitigation Steps Taken

While dependencies are being updated, the following security measures are already in place:

1. **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers including CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options
2. **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS setup with allowed origins
3. **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are rate-limited
4. **Input Validation**: All API inputs are validated
5. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information
6. **Environment Variables**: Secrets are properly managed via environment variables
7. **Conditional MSW Loading**: MSW only loads in development

## Recommendations

1. **Update Dependencies Immediately**: The Next.js vulnerabilities are actively exploitable
2. **Enable Dependabot**: Set up automated security updates
3. **Regular Audits**: Run `pnpm audit` before each deployment
4. **Security Testing**: Add security tests to the test suite
5. **WAF Consideration**: Consider using a Web Application Firewall in production

## Compliance Status

- ✅ No hardcoded secrets
- ✅ Proper authentication checks
- ✅ Input validation implemented
- ✅ Rate limiting active
- ⚠️ Dependencies need updates
- ⚠️ No automated security scanning

## Next Steps

1. Update all vulnerable dependencies
2. Re-run security audit
3. Implement automated security scanning
4. Document security procedures
5. Create incident response plan
