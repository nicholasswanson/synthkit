# Synthkit Build Success ðŸŽ‰

All core packages have been successfully created and built!

## Packages Created

### Core Packages âœ…
- **@synthkit/sdk** - Core SDK with generators, packs loader, config, and state management
- **@synthkit/client** - React provider, PersonaSwitcher, ScenarioPanel, and MSW integration  
- **@synthkit/mcp-synth** - MCP server for AI-powered scenario operations
- **@synthkit/cli** - Command-line interface with init, mock, scenario, and snapshot commands

### Scenario Packs âœ…
- **@synthkit/pack-core** - Basic generators (person, company, address, post, comment)
- **@synthkit/pack-saas** - SaaS generators (user, team, subscription, invoice, API key)
- **@synthkit/pack-ecomm** - E-commerce generators (product, order, customer, cart, review)

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Build all packages:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

3. Try the CLI:
   ```bash
   cd tools/cli
   pnpm build
   node dist/cli.js --help
   ```

4. Create a new project:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop
   node /Users/nicholasswanson/synthkit/tools/cli/dist/cli.js init my-test-app
   ```

## Next Steps

- Complete the Next.js example app (in `examples/next-app`)
- Create the OpenAPI mock example (in `examples/openapi-mock`)
- Publish packages to npm
- Add more scenario packs
- Write tests for all packages

## Architecture Summary

The project uses:
- **pnpm workspaces** for monorepo management
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **tsup** for building packages
- **Vitest** for testing (configured but tests not written yet)
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality
- **Zustand** for state management in the SDK
- **MSW** for API mocking capabilities
- **Commander** for CLI
- **MCP SDK** for AI tool integration

All packages are configured as ES modules with proper TypeScript support.
